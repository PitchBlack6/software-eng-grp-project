Abstract
Orphan, or underutilized, legumes are domesticated legumes with useful properties, but with less importance than 
major world crops due to use and supply constraints. However, they play a significant role in many developing coun-
tries, providing food security and nutrition to consumers, as well as income to resource-poor farmers. They have been 
largely neglected by both researchers and industry due to their limited economic importance in the global market. 
Orphan legumes are better adapted than the major legume crops to extreme soil and climatic conditions, with high 
tolerance to abiotic environmental stresses such as drought. As a stress response they can also produce compounds 
with pharmaceutical value. Orphan legumes are therefore a likely source of important traits for introduction into major 
crops to aid in combating the stresses associated with global climate change. Modern large-scale genomics tech-
niques are now being applied to many of these previously understudied crops, with the first successes reported in 
the genomics area. However, greater investment of resources and manpower are necessary if the potential of orphan 
legumes is to be unlocked and applied in the future.

Key words:  Cowpea, drought, grass pea, legumes, marama bean, Omics technologies.

Introduction
Orphan crops are a diverse set of minor crops that tend to be 
regionally  important  but  not  traded  around  the  world  and 
as such have received little attention from research networks. 
Developing countries, however, rely on these crops to allevi-
ate protein and micronutrient deficiencies associated with the 
predominance of dietary calories from rice (Oryza spp.) and 
wheat  (Triticum  aestivum),  which  are  researched  heavily  by 
private corporations (IPGRI, 2002). Orphan or underutilized 
crops, including orphan legume crops, are staple food crops 
in many developing countries, but their economic importance 
in  global  markets  is  limited  (Naylor  et  al.,  2004).  They  are 
primarily grown by traditional farmers, especially by women, 
to  provide  families  with  food  security  of  high  nutritional 

value  (Nelson,  2016).  These  species  may  be  widely  distrib-
uted beyond their centres of origin but tend to occupy spe-
cial niches in the local production and consumption systems. 
They are important for the subsistence of local communities, 
yet  they  remain  poorly  documented  and  neglected  by  the 
mainstream research and development activities. Although it 
is  difficult  to  precisely  define  which  attributes  make  a  crop 
either underutilized or an orphan, they are often linked with 
the cultural heritage of their places of origin, are poorly doc-
umented as to their cultivation and use, and are adapted to 
specific agro-ecological niches and marginal land with weak 
or no formal seed supply systems. They can also be used as 
animal feed and in other agricultural applications generating

income  for  resource-poor  farmers  (Tadele,  2009).  However, 
owing to their lack of economic importance, they have been 
neglected  by  both  the  international  scientific  community 
and  by  industry  when  compared  to  commodities  such  as 
rice,  corn  (Zea  mays),  and  wheat  (Foyer  et  al.,  2016).  This 
neglect  has  also  resulted  in  a  lack  of  genetic  improvement, 
resulting in inferior yield in terms of both quality and quan-
tity. As a future food crop, orphan crops have predominantly 
been  investigated  by  scientists  in  developing  countries  with 
the  help  of  international  organizations,  for  example,  the 
International  Crops  Research  Institute  for  the  Semi-Arid 
Tropics (ICRISAT).

Typical  orphan  legume  crops  include  cowpea  (Vigna 
unguiculata),  groundnut  (Arachis  hypogaea),  grass  pea 
(Lathyrus sativus) and bambara groundnut (V. subterranea). 
The  Kirkhouse  Trust,  which  focuses  on  crop  improvement 
research using modern molecular methods to improve locally 
important legume crops, also classes horse gram (Macrotyloma 
uniflorum), moth bean (V. aconitifolia), dolichos (Lablab pur-
pureus), and marama bean (Tylosema esculentum) as impor-
tant orphan legumes with the potential to be developed into a 
crop  (http://www.kirkhousetrust.org/orphanlegumes.html#.
V0AvnfmLTIU). Cowpea is an example of an orphan legume 
crop  with  a  wide  spectrum  of  importance,  for  both  human 
and animal health. Many cowpea-based products have also 
found their way into the cosmetic, food, textile, and pharma-
ceutical industry owing to the legume’s therapeutic properties 
(Singh and Basu, 2012). Cowpea and other orphan legumes, 
such as the dolichos bean, which is an ancient legume crop 

(Murphy  and  Colucci,  1999),  are  also  valuable  to  humans 
with limited access to animal protein. Cowpea seeds have a 
high protein content (25% of dry weight) and the protein con-
tent of cowpea leaves annually consumed in Africa and Asia 
is  equivalent  to  5  million  tons  of  dry  cowpea  seeds  (Steele 
et al., 1985). Cowpeas and other orphan legume crops are also 
a rich source of vitamins and minerals (Singh et al., 2003); 
the  high  lysine  content  of  cowpea  is  used  to  supplement 
cereal-based diets low in lysine (Lambot, 2002). The increas-
ing world population will result in a substantial demand for 
additional protein, and therefore the importance of legumes 
in human nutrition is likely to grow.

Orphan crops are generally more adapted to the extreme 
soil and climatic conditions that exist in many parts of the 
world than are the major world food crops. Orphan legumes 
therefore  provide  valuable  information  about  traits  useful 
for  survival  under  harsh  environmental  conditions  such  as 
drought.  However,  despite  this  potential,  barriers  for  crop 
development  and  the  increased  cultivation  of  these  orphan 
legumes frequently include low seed set and the lack of effi-
cient harvesting techniques. Marama bean, for example, has 
a limited seed yield, low propagation rates, and is a ground 
creeper  covering  large  areas  (Fig.  1),  making  it  difficult  to 
harvest (Keegan and Van Staden, 1981).

To  our  knowledge,  a  review  has  not  yet  been  performed 
to  examine  the  characteristics  that  render  orphan  legumes 
exceptional  and  whether  such  characteristics  can  be  trans-
ferred to major legume crops. We focus here on the character-
istics of marama bean and grass pea, two representatives of

Unlocking the potential of orphan legumes  |  Page 3 of 9

orphan legumes that survive under low water availability and 
that  also  produce  pharmaceutically  interesting  compounds 
possibly as a stress response. In addition, ‘omics’ studies are 
already, or will soon be, available for orphan legumes. In this 
review,  the  existing  knowledge  and  recent  developments  in 
‘omics’ analyses will be highlighted. More extensive research 
in these ‘omics’ areas will very likely allow orphan legumes 
to more rapidly join the list of the world’s major food crops.

Tolerating drought stress
Higher thermal and drought tolerance allows orphan legumes 
to grow in hot and dry climates under rain-fed conditions on 
marginal land. Such growth under drought conditions and on 
marginal land is either barely achievable or not achievable at all 
with major food crop plants (Muehlbauer et al., 1985; Tilahun 
and Schubert, 2003; Thomas et al., 2004; Munoz-Perea et al., 
2006). There is interest in investigating the basis of their high 
tolerance to drought and heat with a view to transferring spe-
cific  genes  coding  for  these  unique  characteristics  to  major 
food crop species. A plant can respond to drought by modify-
ing its morphology and physiology as adaptive mechanisms. 
These drought responses include reduction of leaf expansion, 
closing  of  stomata,  shifting  the  ratio  of  shoot  to  root  bio-
mass, and changing root characteristics (Bultynck et al., 2004; 
Franks,  2013;  Koevoets  et  al.,  2016).  Legume  performance 
under  drought  stress  is  closely  related  to  root  system  devel-
opment and root system distribution (Newman and Mosser, 
1988; Gaur et al., 2008). Greater root depth and root biomass 
allow a more efficient extraction of any available soil moisture 
(Blum et al., 2011; Fenta et al., 2014), and root growth in leg-
umes increases during the vegetative growth period but slows 
down when seed filling begins (Gregory, 1988; Abdelhamid, 
2010).  Root  hydraulic  conductivity,  which  depends  on  the 
diameter and the distribution of the meta-xylem vessels, has 
also  been  found  to  provide  better  drought  tolerance  in  leg-
umes. For example, the root length density is much lower in 
the  grain  legume  chickpea  (Cicer  arietinum)  than  in  barley 
(Hordeum  vulgare),  but  better  hydraulic  conductivity  allows 
the  legume  to  more  efficiently  absorb  water  (Thomas  et  al., 
1995).  Certain  tepary  bean  (Phaseolus  acutifolius)  lines  also 
have deeper roots, with the greatest root mass in the deepest 
soil  profile.  Such  adaptations  result  in  more  efficient  water 
uptake.  The  bean  also  has  small  leaves  to  reduce  water  use 
and  lower  stomatal  conductance  as  adaptive  characteristics 
for water conservation (Mohameda et al., 2002).

However, the question that remains is what is the basis of 
this  ability  to  withstand  severe  environmental  stress  condi-
tions?  The  existing  literature  provides  information  about 
measuring drought tolerance by applying standard morpho-
logical and physiological tools to identify more drought-toler-
ant orphan legumes but does not identify any specific unique 
traits. Although orphan legumes in many ways respond like 
other  crop  plants  to  drought,  the  two  examples  considered 
here, the marama bean and grass pea, illustrate why orphan 
legumes  could  be  exceptional  in  their  ability  to  survive  in 
stressful environments.

The  marama  bean,  in  which  we  have  particular  interest, 
has the potential to become a useful crop in the arid condi-
tions in Africa, because the bean is well adapted to survive 
under the unfavourable conditions that exist, for example, in 
the Kalahari desert (Powell 1987; Nepolo et al., 2009). The 
protein and oil content of the marama bean is comparable 
to  those  of  soybean  (Glycine  max)  and  groundnut  (Bower 
et  al.,  1988).  Marama  grows  rapidly  under  non-stress  con-
ditions  with  runners  extending  along  the  ground  (Mitchell 
et al., 2005). It is highly branched and produces a great num-
ber  of  leaves  (Fig.  1).  The  marama  bean  does  not  possess 
nodules  for  nitrogen  fixation.  This  possibly  avoids  nitrogen 
restriction given the known sensitivity of nodules and nitro-
gen  fixation  to  drought  conditions  (Serraj  et  al.,  1999).  It 
is  not  particularly  drought  tolerant,  despite  growing  in  the 
desert, because its vegetative growth is affected by drought. 
However, marama has a tuber that serves as a water reservoir. 
The plant, as a possible drought avoider, can therefore sur-
vive on the stored water and assimilates in the tuber (Fig. 1). 
This allows rapid vegetative re-growth under more favourable 
conditions (Travlos and Karamanos, 2008). There is also evi-
dence that marama is endowed with several drought avoid-
ance mechanisms, which, in parallel with osmotic adjustment, 
enable it to survive under very harsh conditions (Karamanos 
and Travlos, 2012).

Grass pea is cultivated worldwide and is one of the cheapest 
sources of dietary protein in the developing world (Enneking, 
2011). It is an excellent example of a drought-adapted orphan 
legume with high water-use efficiency (Sekhon et al., 2010). 
No legume other than grass pea has, in fact, ever served as 
a staple food. The grass pea is among the priority crops in 
Kew’s Millennium Seed Bank and the Global Crop Diversity 
Trust  project  ‘Adapting  Agriculture  to  Climate  Change’. 
A primary objective of Kew’s project is to collect and pro-
tect the genetic diversity of a portfolio of plants with traits 
required for adapting the world’s most important food crops 
to  climate  change.  Such  adaptation  is  considered  a  key 
component  in  securing  the  world’s  future  food  production 
(Dempewolf et al., 2014). For more than 100 million people 
in Asia and Africa, the grass pea is a traditional crop that is 
easy to cultivate under stressful growth conditions (Vaz Patto 
and Rubiales, 2014). The grass pea is an ‘insurance crop’ that 
is capable of producing reliable yields when all other crops fail 
because of drought. In contrast to marama bean, grass pea 
possess a combination of traits that allow it both to escape 
drought  and  to  avoid  dehydration.  To  escape  drought,  the 
plant matures early, a characteristic that can avoid any termi-
nal drought. To avoid dehydration, there is both a reduction 
in the green leaf area, to keep a higher water status for main-
taining photosynthesis, and a reduction in stomatal conduct-
ance. The grass pea also reduces flower and pod production 
under stress and concentrates its resources in a small number 
of surviving pods (Gusmao, 2010). Another important fea-
ture to note is that the threshold soil water content at which 
seed set is reduced coincides with that at which the leaf sto-
matal conductance and photosynthetic rate start to decrease 
(Kong et al., 2015). However, any physiological responses due 
to drought only start when that soil water threshold has been

passed (Zaman-Allah et al., 2011). Of particular interest, the 
decrease in photosynthesis as well as the cessation of flower 
and pod production is more prominent in grass pea than in 
the grain legume chickpea (Kong et al., 2015). Thus, despite 
chickpea  maintaining  a  better  flower  and  pod  production 
than grass pea under drought, such drought-exposed chick-
pea  pods  do  not  produce  any  seeds  under  such  conditions 
(Pang et al., 2016), while grass pea does produce seeds.

Producing useful compounds
Plants,  in  order  to  survive  stressful  environments,  can  syn-
thesize a range of secondary metabolites and proteinaceous 
inhibitors in response to an environmental stress (Bora, 2014). 
Marama bean, for example, produces a serine protease inhib-
itor, a unique characteristic of this orphan legume, and 10.5% 
of  its  total  protein  can  consist  of  this  inhibitor  (Nadaraja 
et al., 2010). A possible function of the inhibitor is as an anti-
feedant. However, the possibility that the inhibitor also func-
tions in controlling proteolytic events in marama bean, which 
may be associated with its growth in arid areas with little water 
availability,  has  not  yet  been  studied  (Kunert  et  al.,  2015). 
Such protective compounds can also significantly contribute 
to  human  and  animal  health.  The  marama  serine  protease 
inhibitor  strongly  prevents  elastase  activity.  As  part  of  the 
chymotrypsin-like clan, human elastase is involved in various 
inflammatory  disorders,  including  pulmonary  emphysema, 
sepsis, arthritis, nephritis, and certain skin diseases (Bonnart 
et al., 2010). Marama serine protease inhibitor could there-
fore potentially be therapeutic not only for these diseases but 
also as a skin cream additive. Overall, these non-food prop-
erties ultimately add value to the marama bean and provide 
strong support for further developing marama into an impor-
tant food and cash crop in arid areas. The marama tuber also 
has  interesting  starch  characteristics.  The  starch  content  of 
the tuber can be up to 10% on a fresh weight basis, compared 
with potato tubers that have, for example, 15% (Nepolo et al., 
2015). An evaluation of the physical properties of marama 
starch by rapid visco-analysis indicated a high viscosity with 
a potential to form strong gels, a property which might be of 
interest to the food industry.

Grass pea is highly resistant to pests and diseases, as well 
as  to  abiotic  environmental  stresses.  It  is  the  latter  charac-
teristic  that  we  will  focus  on.  Grass  pea  produces  the  non‐
protein  amino  acid  β-N-oxalyl-L-α,β-diaminopropionic 
acid, or ODAP, in addition to phenolic and flavonoid com-
pounds and antioxidants (Rao et al., 1964; Enneking, 2011; 
Talukdar,  2012).  The  ODAP  content  increases  in  response 
to stress and the compound can scavenge hydroxyl radicals 
produced by oxidative stress (Gongkea et al., 2001). Despite 
this potential, ODAP can cause problems when grass pea is 
consumed by humans because it is a neurotoxin and causes 
paralysis of the lower body, known as lathyrism (Singh and 
Rao,  2013).  Lathyrism  develops  when  grass  pea  seeds  are 
consumed exclusively as a primary protein source for a pro-
longed time, although no lathyrism occurs when grass pea is 
consumed only as part of a normal diet and not as the only 

component of the diet (Singh and Rao, 2013). There is evi-
dence that ODAP can be detoxified in humans but not in ani-
mals (Pratap Rudra et al., 2004), but the disease still exists in 
Eastern Africa (Eritrea and Ethiopia). The development of 
low‐toxin varieties would make a significant contribution to 
increasing the impact of grass pea for food security for mil-
lions of people. Unfortunately, conventional plant breeding 
techniques for the development of such low-ODAP seeds has 
not been successful (Girma and Korbu, 2012). This lack of 
breeding success could, however, be overcome by the appli-
cation  of  the  newly  developed  gene-editing  capabilities  of 
CRISPR/Cas systems to specifically modify the ODAP path-
way once identified (Cong et al., 2013).

The negative perception of grass pea, due to its toxic effects, 
has recently also changed, because grass pea is also the only 
known dietary source for L-homoarginine (Singh and Rao, 
2013)  and  for  the  properties  of  L-ODAP.  L-homoarginine 
provides benefits in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases 
and in overcoming the hypoxia associated with cancer tumour 
development (Singh and Rao, 2013). L-homoarginine acts as 
a  substrate  for  endogenous  nitric  oxide  (NO)  production. 
NO, a signalling molecule, has an important role in cardio-
vascular diseases and hypertension control (Jyothi and Rao, 
1999). Because L-homoarginine is also a poor substrate for 
arginase, the compound persists longer in the circulation than 
arginine. L-ODAP might also stabilize hypoxia inducible fac-
tor-1 (HIF-1), which changes the transcriptional response of 
tumours under hypoxia (Ziello et al., 2007). In vitro studies 
with human neuroblastoma cells have already demonstrated 
that L-ODAP can stabilize (nuclear translocate) HIF-1 and 
prevent  the  consequences  of  hypoxia  (Ke  and  Costa,  2006; 
Jammulamadaka et al., 2011). L-ODAP also activates protein 
kinase C (Singh, 2004). Although known kinase C activators 
can be neurotrophic with neuroprotective properties (Nelson 
and  Alkon,  2009),  most  kinase  C  activators  are  apoptotic. 
Therefore, there is a constant search for non-apoptotic kinase 
C activators. If L-ODAP does have non-apoptotic character-
istics, the compound might have potential for application in 
neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.

Omics-enabled improvement of orphan 
legumes
The  relationship  between  the  genotype  and  phenotype  is 
complex,  which  makes  it  challenging  to  predict  the  phe-
notype  based  on  the  genotype.  The  level  of  information 
needed  to  implement  genomic-assisted  breeding  has  stead-
ily  increased  as  the  cost  of  acquiring  nucleic  acid  sequence 
information  has  rapidly  decreased.  A  few  years  ago,  it  was 
generally  believed  that  genome  sequence  would  be  an  ena-
bling  first  step  in  implementing  genomic-assisted  breeding 
(Varshney et al., 2009 and 2012b; Young and Bharati, 2012). 
However, it is now understood that a single genomic sequence 
is only a snapshot of part of the diversity within a species. 
This relationship is further complicated when the experimen-
tal material is composed of land races, which most orphan 
legumes  are,  rather  than  well-documented  inbred  lines.

Unlocking the potential of orphan legumes  |  Page 5 of 9

These land races have different combinations of useful genes 
(or alleles), making it more difficult to identify those to target 
for  selection  and  incorporation  into  new  varieties.  In  addi-
tion, a robust phenotyping platform is essential to ensure that 
the evaluation of the genotype and environment interaction 
can be adequately performed and that the same phenotype is 
actually being studied.

One of the orphan legumes with the most applied molecu-
lar data is cowpea. The genomic information for cowpea has 
been used in the evaluation of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) 
for a number of traits and for identifying the diversity of land 
races. An important resource in the identification of QTLs, 
especially  using  simple-sequence  repeat  (SSR)  markers,  has 
been the development of a series of recombinant inbred lines. 
This  plant  material  can  be  phenotyped  and  DNA  isolated 
from the individual phenotyped plants. Any of the traits that 
are segregating from the initial parents can then be followed 
and  be  associated  with  particular  regions  of  the  chromo-
somes.  This  has  allowed  the  development  of  an  integrated 
genetic  map  using  molecular  markers  (Timko  and  Singh, 
2008). These molecular markers, and their subsequent exten-
sion, have been the basis for implementing QTL identification 
and the subsequent marker-assisted selection for a number of 
traits. The traits that have been characterized to date include 
those  for  flowering  time  (Andargie  et  al.,  2013),  domesti-
cation  (Andargie  et  al.,  2011),  and  floral  scent  compounds 
(Andargie  et  al.,  2014).  These  studies  were  only  made  pos-
sible by the previous work in developing and phenotyping the 
recombinant inbred lines, but this particular population only 
captured a small amount of the natural variation in cowpea. 
For a number of crop species, association mapping popula-
tions are being developed that capture the maximum diver-
sity, such as the multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross 
(MAGIC)  populations  in  rice  (Bandillo  et  al.,  2013).  Four 
multi-parent  populations  were  created  containing  desirable 
traits for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, yield, and grain 
quality in order to fine map QTLs for multiple traits and to 
use the highly recombined lines in breeding programmes.

In  sunflower  (Helianthus  annuus),  a  similar  associa-
tion  mapping  population  consisting  of  288  lines  has  been 
described  by  Mandel  et  al.  (2011).  In  this  case,  a  diverse 
collection  of  cultivated  sunflower  lines  was  genotyped  with 
SSR  markers  distributed  across  the  complete  genome  and 
the data were then used to identify subsets of lines that cap-
tured  the  maximum  diversity  present  in  the  initial  popula-
tion. These types of association mapping populations need to 
be constructed and characterized for the important orphan 
legumes, incorporating as much germplasm diversity as pos-
sible. Such populations will then enable the identification of 
loci underlying important stress tolerances within these crops. 
Ultimately, they will permit the isolation of the genes under-
lying these traits, for their possible incorporation into other 
crop  plants.  However,  the  development  of  such  association 
mapping populations for the orphan legumes will require a 
long,  dedicated,  funded,  international  collaborative  effort. 
First,  an  appropriate  marker  set  will  have  to  be  developed. 
Next, large populations of land races will need to be geno-
typed to reveal the extent of genetic diversity, followed by the 

inter-crossing of the selected lines and the extraction of the 
inbred material for phenotyping. As noted in the next section, 
the falling costs of next-generation sequencing mean that the 
use of SSR and/or single nucleotide polymorphisms for diver-
sity analysis and association mapping could be superseded by 
genotyping by sequencing.

The  contribution  of  genomics  to  the  improvement  of 
orphan legumes has been initiated through the ever-decreasing 
DNA sequencing costs. The combination of high-throughput 
DNA sequencing from the Illumina platform combined with 
the long read information from PacBio data and new linking 
technologies, such as those from Dovetail genomics (https://
dovetailgenomics.com), has made it possible to obtain high-
quality  genomic  assemblies  with  long  contiguous  segments 
for  most  plant  organisms  (Table  1).  Once  the  basic  genome 
has been assembled, characterization of the genome space can 
be  extended  at  relatively  low  cost  through  the  implementa-
tion of reduced representation libraries, such as those used in 
the genotyping-by-sequencing approach (Elshire et al., 2011), 
although the genotyping-by-sequencing approach is not con-
tingent on a reference genome being available. This approach 
increases  the  precision  of  identifying  differences  across  the 
whole genome more rapidly and at a lower cost than earlier 
DNA  marker  technologies.  For  species  that  are  essentially 
outcrossing, which is the case for marama bean, the levels of 
heterozygosity  will  further  complicate  the  identification  of 
useful alleles in developing genomic selection schemes.

An alternative method of reducing the complexity of the 
genome is to focus on the expressed portion of the genome. 
RNA  sequencing  has  been  a  route  to  identify  new  genetic 
markers for some orphan legumes such as Bituminaria bitu-
minosa  (Pazos-Navarro  et  al.,  2011).  The  availability  of 
new  tools  for  both  the  de  novo  assembly  of  transcriptomes 
and  alignment  to  newly  assembled  genomes  will  allow  the 
identification  of  differential  gene  expression  in  response  to 
stress.  However,  because  the  transcriptome  is  developmen-
tally  controlled,  the  anatomical  site  of  any  stress  tolerance 
needs to be identified so that the appropriate tissues can be 
sampled. Interpretation of such RNA sequencing studies is 
still  dependent  on  an  understanding  of  the  genetic  under-
pinnings  of  stress  tolerance  in  order  to  unravel  the  causa-
tive  versus  consequential  transcriptional  variations.  Finally, 
the  transcriptome  represents  the  expressed  portion  of  the 
genome while the proteome is a reflection of that subset of 
the transcriptome that is translated into proteins. Proteomics 
in orphan legumes is still rare, with grass pea being one of the 
few with such studies (Rathi et al., 2015). Differential prot-
eomics to identify stress-responsive molecules would require 
a significant investment in time and resources, such that the 
development of genetic stocks that would be most informa-
tive for such studies is a pre-requisite.

Learning from orphan legumes and where 
to go
Orphan  legumes  are  widely  distributed  and  a  good  source 
for  the  study  of  stress  tolerance,  such  as  drought  tolerance

(Table 2), which is of interest because drought is one of the 
consequences  of  the  predicted  climate  change.  However, 
drought-tolerant  orphan  legumes  probably  do  not  have 
unique traits, but rather have specific combinations of com-
mon traits, with some more prominent than others. They can 
also possess traits unusual for a legume, such as producing 
a  tuber.  All  these  traits  together  contribute  to  their  greater 
level of drought tolerance. Developing an understanding of 
both the specific traits and the importance of the combina-
tion of traits could ultimately help us to improve the selec-
tion, or even the engineering, of lines that possess the most 
efficient combinations of such traits in many species. Major 
food  crops  have  simply  lost  some  of  these  traits  or  combi-
nations of traits owing to selection for the best-performing 
cultivars under a given growth condition, resulting in a loss 
in both genetic diversity and valuable traits (Li et al., 2013; 
Valliyodan et al., 2016). Therefore, it is unlikely that we will 
identify a single gene that provides tolerance against a stress 
like drought, which affects many plant processes. The major-
ity of the existing genetically engineered plants that carry a 
single gene to provide better drought tolerance simply exhibit 
a delayed onset of drought stress effects (Lawlor, 2013).

Orphan legumes are still an untouched treasure trove for 
compounds that not only provide the plant with stress toler-
ance but are also capable of contributing to human health. 
As nutraceuticals they might serve in functional food to man-
age diseases and disorders associated with a changed lifestyle, 
or as a basis for new drug development in areas of cardio-
vascular physiology, hypoxia, and cancer (Rao, 2011; Singh 
and Rao, 2013; Van Wyk et al., 2016). Grass pea is an excel-
lent example of a potential ‘functional food’, being the only 
known  source  for  L-homoarginine.  This  compound  might 
prevent  hypertension,  a  major  risk  factor  for  heart  attacks 
and strokes. However, rather limited research has so far been 

conducted  to  identify  and  characterize  other  potent  stress 
response compounds produced in orphan legumes.

Finally,  the  characterization  of  orphan  legumes  on  the 
‘omics’ level is still in its infancy. These legumes remain unex-
plored  on  the  genomic,  transcriptomic,  and  the  proteomic 
level,  although  efforts  such  as  the  African  Orphan  Crops 
Initiative  (http://africanorphancrops.org)  are  starting  to  fill 
the genomics information gap. In spite of the rapid develop-
ments  of  new  ‘omics’  capabilities,  an  enhanced  investment 
into  the  molecular  characterization  of  these  orphan  leg-
umes is still necessary to explore their full potential. A first 
good example of how ‘omics’ can contribute is represented 
by pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan). This orphan legume crop is 
mainly grown by poor farmers and is known as the poor peo-
ple’s meat because of its high protein content. Pigeon pea is 
still the exception regarding ‘omics’, owing to the recent com-
pletion of its genome sequence and therefore its potential to 
soon enter the world’s ‘league’ of major food crops (Varshney 
et  al.,  2012a).  Pigeon  pea  is  also  among  the  most  drought-
tolerant and nutritious orphan legume crops (for an overview, 
see  Odeny,  2007).  This  legume  withstands  drought  because 
of its deep roots and osmotic adjustment in the leaves. The 
unique  polycarpic  flowering  habit  further  sheds  any  repro-
ductive  structures  when  under  stress  (Mligo  and  Craufurd, 
2005). An advanced understanding of the pigeon pea genome 
could  have  a  significant  impact  on  improving  crop  produc-
tivity by more easily identifying genes associated with these 
specific characteristics that render pigeon pea highly drought 
tolerant. So far, over 40 000 pigeon pea genes have been iden-
tified and several hundred of these genes are associated with 
drought tolerance.

Many  orphan  legume  crops  will  soon  have  a  genome 
sequence  (www.Africanorphancrops.org),  and  thus  might  no 
longer be described as having been bypassed by the molecular

genetic  revolution.  However,  they  could  still  be  classified  as 
orphan  crops  owing  to  the  paucity  of  resources  assigned  to 
their development. By focusing resources on these orphan leg-
umes, important genes for both increasing stress tolerance and 
for human health can be uncovered and subsequently imple-
mented in many new areas. Extending this initial information 
into practical applications will need, however, human capacity 
to build in the areas of molecular technologies and bioinformat-
ics, as well as to provide the infrastructure to continue building 
on the preliminary information. For marama bean, the authors 
are  currently  meeting  some  of  these  needs  by  incorporating 
relevant research projects into the undergraduate curriculum 
at Case Western Reserve University to advance the characteri-
zation and improvement of this orphan legume into a useful 
crop.  Within  this  framework,  a  whole-genome  sequence  has 
been  assembled  from  Illumina  reads  that  has  a  sufficiently 
robust  assembly  to  identify  genes  of  interest  (Cullis,  unpub-
lished). We have already used the initial assembled contigs to 
identify marama cysteine proteases and cystatins with unique 
amino  acid  compositions  based  on  the  conserved  regions  of 
these proteins (Cullis and Kunert, unpublished). These novel 
proteins can already be expressed and their properties evalu-
ated to determine if they have potential for use in improving 
other crops, in human health applications, or in both. We are 

also investigating the presence of genes necessary for nodula-
tion,  and  other  mycorrhizal  associations,  to  understand  why 
this legume does not nodulate but is still able to thrive in poor 
soils.  The  next  step  in  the  project  will  include  surveying  the 
diversity of marama bean across southern Africa to construct 
and analyse MAGIC populations. These will serve as an impor-
tant resource for the isolation and transfer of genes for stress 
resilience that will facilitate crop improvement (Pandey et al., 
2016). This population will be grown, phenotyped, and geno-
typed to identify a possible set of lines for association mapping 
for important domestication, yield, and stress-tolerance traits. 
However, as with all plant breeding projects, the time interval 
between  initiation  and  the  development  of  the  experimental 
material requires patience and continual funding. Because we 
are using this project to involve a succession of undergraduate 
and graduate students in a course-based research experience, 
the expectation is that the effort will be successful in the long 
term.  The  germplasm  improvement  and  release  to  resource-
poor farmers in the region will be the ultimate demonstration 
of the success of this approach. Such an approach could ben-
efit all the orphan legume crops as an improvement strategy, 
and the recruitment of students in developed countries would 
help alleviate, in the short term, the lack of human capital to 
analyse the data arising from such genomics projects.
